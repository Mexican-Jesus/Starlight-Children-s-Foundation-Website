        <p class="a">Starlight's vision is that everyone experiences a happy childhood, because happiness matters.<br>
        <br>
        Serious childhood illness doesn’t just impact a child’s health.  It can turn their whole life upside <br> down, causing them to miss out on spending time with their family, building friendships, going<br> to school and just living their life.<br> 
        <br>
        Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. But sick children and young people<br> need more than the exceptional care that our clinicians can offer.  They need the social and<br> emotional support that lets them be a child.<br>
        <br>
        This is Starlight’s job. For over 30 years we have used play, social connection and creativity to<br> support children and young people in some of their toughest times and to positively change<br> their healthcare experience.<br>
        <br>
        We work alongside clinicians, wherever they go, from by the bedside in a major paediatric hospital<br> to mobile clinics visiting remote communities. Working in partnership to deliver the best possible<br> care for children and young people across the whole country, so that they can live their best lives.</p>
