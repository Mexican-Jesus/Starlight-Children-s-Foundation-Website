        <p>Starlight's vision is that everyone experiences a happy childhood, because happiness matters.<br>
        <br>
        Serious childhood illness doesn’t just impact a child’s health.  It can turn their whole life upside down, causing them to miss out on spending time with their family, building friendships, going to school and just living their life.<br> 
        <br>
        Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. But sick children and young people need more than the exceptional care that our clinicians can offer.  They need the social and emotional support that lets them be a child.<br>
        <br>
        This is Starlight’s job. For over 30 years we have used play, social connection and creativity to support children and young people in some of their toughest times and to positively change their healthcare experience.<br>
        <br>
        We work alongside clinicians, wherever they go, from by the bedside in a major paediatric hospital to mobile clinics visiting remote communities. Working in partnership to deliver the best possible care for children and young people across the whole country, so that they can live their best lives.</p>
